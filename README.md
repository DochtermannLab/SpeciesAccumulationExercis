# Species Accumulation Exercise
This exercise was designed to introduce students in an introductory ecology course to topics of population and community sampling. For population sampling and population size estimation, "sampling" was conducted of a population of marked balls (Bingo!). Lincoln-Peterson estimation was used, and the issues with L-P estimation discussed in association with the first part of the provided handout. 

For estimating how many species are present in an area an app, code here, was used to sample the community of ants in La Selva, Costa Rica. The data used to generate the "community" were from Longino, Coddington, and Colwell (2002) Ecology. 83(3):689-702. Specimen of ants were pooled at the genus level and sampling conducted in proportion to representation in collection. The data load with the app. 

Total samples, unique genera, and the genus collected during a sampling event are recorded and a species accumulation curve plotted based on the raw number of unique genera (i.e. no fitted line or estimated total). This app can be used to examine sampling (Part III of the app) and diversity measures for the community (Part III of the handout).

Included:
Shiny code, includes UI and server functions in single script (app.r)
In-class handout (PopCommAnalysis.pdf & PopCommAnalysis.docx)
Associated powerpoint (lacks instructor notes so very barebones; (10)CalculatingPopandCommunityParameters(2_November).pptx))
